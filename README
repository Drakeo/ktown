KDE 5_1501
==========

This is going to be KDE 5 for Slackware-current, composed of Frameworks 5.6.0,
Plasma 5.1.2 and Applications 14.12.1.

Compared to Applications 14.12.0, the Applications 14.12.1 adds LTS releases of
kdelibs, kdepimlibs, kdepim-runtime, kdepim and kde-workspace.

Note that there is still a lot of KDE 4 stuff in here, which is necessary to
support all the Applications that have not yet been ported to KDE Frameworks 5.
The Applications 15.04 (march 2015) release should offer a lot more KF5 ports.

Preliminary build procedure (not verified 100% yet):
----------------------------------------------------

- (crude) get rid of Slackware's KDE: removepkg /var/log/packages/*-4.10.5-*
- build all the deps using "updates.SlackBuild" script in the "deps/" directory
  - note that extra-cmake-modules is required here as well as when building the
    frameworks, so I just copied it from frameworks to deps.
  - I removed akonadi-qt5 from the built deps because it won't be used until
    there is a kdepimlibs-framework, and currently it causes kdepimlibs-4.14
    to pick up Qt5 dependencies making its build fail
- logoff/login to activate Qt5 profile script.
- build all the KDE 4 stuff in the "kde/" directory, using "./KDE.SlackBuild kde
libs kdebase:nepomuk-core kdepimlibs kdebase kdebindings kdebase:kde-workspace k
depim extragear"
- check that everything built correctly
- build the remaining KDE 5 stuff in the "kde/" directory, using "./KDE.SlackBui
ld frameworks plasma plasma-extra polkit-kde applications"
- check that everything built correctly
- build kdei

BUILD LOG FOR PLASMA-EXTRA:

TODO: sddm-qt5 (no longer adds an /etc/sddm.conf so we need to generate one in its doinst.sh)

BUILD LOG FOR APPLICATIONS:

TODO: kdoctools (needs a fix for its CMake search for path to "/usr/share/xml/docbook/xml-dtd-4.5/docbookx.dtd", which causes a build error in kde-dev-scripts later on)
TODO: kde-dev-scripts (needs a fixed "/usr/share/kf5/kdoctools/customization/dtd/kdex.dtd" in kdoctools)
SKIP: libkface (needs opencv, so this will get skipped due to my reservations with it)
DONE: kdeartwork (missed kde-workspace, will be fixed in the next iteration)
DONE: kdewebdev (seems like tidy added the KDE.SlackBuild parameter to the path of its header file)
DONE: kalgebra (needs patch to link properly to ncurses)
DONE: kanagram (needed libkeduvocdocument, was missing due to build order issue)
DONE: khangman (needed libkeduvocdocument, was missing due to build order issue)
DONE: parley (needed libkeduvocdocument, was missing due to build order issue)
