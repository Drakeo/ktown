KDE4.10
=======

This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.10.5 for Slackware 14.0.
Now that Slackware-current has an official set of KDE 4.10.x packages,
provided by Patrick Volkerding, I am offering my own packages for
Slackware 14.0 - so that users of this stable release can enjoy the
KDE upgrade as well.
This is the last incremental release in the 4.10 series, which probably
means that this is the last version of KDE4 that I will be compiling for
Slackware 14.  If Pat decides to upgrade to KDE 4.11 in Slackware-current,
then there will be a KDE 4.11 for Slackware 14 as well.

The upgrade from Slackware 14's own 4.8.5 will be trivial.  I added eleven
updated dependencies (PyQt, QScintilla, akonadi, attica, libbluedevil,
phonon-gstreamer, qt, shared-desktop-ontologies, sip, soprano and virtuoso-ose)
and added a new one: qjson.
None of these dependencies were updated since my KDE 4.10.4 package set.

I updated several 'extragear' packages compared to Slackware 14: bluedevil,
calligra, kdevelop, kdevplatform, ktorrent, kwebkitpart, libktorrent,
networkmanagement, oxygen-gtk2, skanlite.  Four extragear packages are all new:
libkscreen, kscreen, oxygen-gtk3 and kio-mtp.
Compared to my previous KDE 4.10.4 package set, I updated libkscreen, kscreen,
oxygen-gtk2 and oxygen-gtk3.

Four KDE packages have been removed since the KDE 4.8.5 of Slackware 14:
* kdegames has been split up into smaller individual packages since 4.10.1.
* kdemultimedia has been split up into smaller individual packages since 4.9.x.
* ksecrets has been removed completely since the 4.9.x series.
* printer-applet has been replaced with print-manager since 4.10.x.

NOTE:
About the language packs (KDEI) - for Slackware 32-bit as well as 64-bit:
* KDE localizations (language packs) are available in "x86_64/kdei". You only
  need one package (for your own language).  Don't let the "x86_64" in the
  directory name fool you, the language packs are useable on both platforms.
  translations/localizations.

NOTE:
If you decide to install these packages on top of a fresh installation of
  Slackware 14 and have excluded all packages in the 'KDE' package series
  during installation, you will be missing several add-on packages, some of
  these are essential to the proper functioning of KDE!
  If you excluded the complete Slackware 14 'KDE' series, then you will
  have to install the following essential packages at a a minimum:
    * polkit-kde-agent-1
    * polkit-kde-kcmodules-1
  And optionally install these as well:
    * amarok
    * k3b
    * kaudiocreator
    * kdevelop-pg-qt
    * kplayer
    * wicd-kde

NOTE:
Sources and scripts have been separated from the packages in my 'ktown
  repository starting with KDE 4.9-rc1.  If you want the sources for
  4.10.5, run the following command to download them:

  # rsync -av rsync://alien.slackbook.org/alien/ktown/source/4.10.5 .

Then if you want to compile the KDE packages on your computer, run:
  # cd 4.10.5/kde
  # ./KDE.SlackBuild

Wait a long time, and you will find the new packages in /tmp/kde-build .
Note that these packages will already have been installed by KDE.SlackBuild !

But if all you want is the packages I created, then you can skip all of that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to install or upgrade to KDE 4.10.5, follow these steps:

Make sure you are not running KDE or even X !  If you are running an X session,
log out first, and if you are in runlevel 4 (graphical login) you first have to
go back to runlevel 3 (console) by typing "init 3".

To make it easy for you, here is a one-line command that downloads the whole
4.10.5 directory (excluding the sources), with 32-bit and 64-bit packages
(and be careful of the 'dot' at the end of that command, it is part of the
commandline !!):

  # rsync -av rsync://alien.slackbook.org/alien/ktown/14.0/4.10.5 .

Or else, if you want to download packages for just one of the two supported
architectures, you would run one of the following commands instead (note that
there is a dot at the end of these commands!).
If you want only the 64-bit packages:
  # rsync -av --exclude=x86 rsync://alien.slackbook.org/alien/ktown/14.0/4.10.5 .
If you want only the 32-bit packages:
  # rsync -av --exclude=x86_64 rsync://alien.slackbook.org/alien/ktown/14.0/4.10.5 .

Assuming you just downloaded the bits you want from the directory tree "4.10.5",
you must now change your current directory to where you found this README
(which is the directory called '4.10.5').  If you used one of the above
"rsync" commands then you can simply do:

  # cd 4.10.5

From within this directory, you run the following commands as root (note that
some of the old KDE package names are obsoleted now, they have been split up,
renamed or integrated and that is the reason for the 'removepkg' lines):

  On Slackware 32-bit:
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86/deps/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86/kde/*.t?z
  # removepkg kdegames
  # removepkg kdemultimedia
  # removepkg ksecrets
  # removepkg printer-applet

  On Slackware 64-bit:
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86_64/deps/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86_64/kde/*.t?z
  # removepkg kdegames
  # removepkg kdemultimedia
  # removepkg ksecrets
  # removepkg printer-applet

  If you already have one or more non-english language packs installed:
  # upgradepkg x86_64/kdei/*.t?z
  
  If you want to have a non-english language pack installed but none is
  currently installed, substitute your country code instead of the 'XX'
  in the next command:
  # upgradepkg --install-new x86_64/kdei/kde-l10n-XX-*.t?z

  Check if any ".new" configuration files have been left behind by
  the upgradepkg commands.  Compare them to their originals and decide
  if you need to use them.
  # find /etc/ -name "*.new"
  A graphical (ncurses) tool for processing these "*.new" files is slackpkg:
  # slackpkg new-config

Then reboot your system.
