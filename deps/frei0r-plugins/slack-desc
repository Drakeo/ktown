# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

frei0r-plugins:
frei0r-plugins: Frei0r is a minimalistic plugin API for video effects.
frei0r-plugins: The main emphasis is on simplicity for an API that will round up
frei0r-plugins: the most common video effects into simple filters, sources and mixers
frei0r-plugins: that can be controlled by parameters.
frei0r-plugins: Its goal is that these simple effects can be shared between many
frei0r-plugins: applications, avoiding their reimplementation by different projects.
