KDE4.8
======

This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.8.4 for Slackware-current.
It is an incremental update to the version 4.8.2 which is part of
Slackware-current.

You have to run Slackware-current in order to use these packages! There has
been an incompatible update of the "glibc" package since the release of
Slackware 13.37.

For backwards compatibility, I will keep packages for KDE 4.6.5 available
in my repository as well.  Those work fine on Slackware 13.37 as well as
-current. KDE 4.6.5 will give you a very stable desktop.

NOTE:
* Possible issue when rebuilding these packages on 13.37: the new kwin seems
  to require at least mesa-7.10 and this is not installed by default.
  Slackware 13.37 has mesa-7.10.2 in the /testing directory though.  Use that.

NOTE:
About the language packs (KDEI) - for Slackware 32-bit as well as 64-bit:
* KDE localizations (language packs) are available in "x86_64/kdei". You only
  need one package (for your own language).  Don't let the "x86_64" in the
  directory name fool you, the language packs are useable on both platforms.

Below are the steps you need to take to install or upgrade to KDE 4.8.4.

Make sure you are not running KDE or even X !  If you are running an X session,
log out first, and if you are in runlevel 4 (graphical login) you first have to
go back to runlevel 3 (console) by typing "init 3".

To make it easy for you, here is a one-line command that downloads the whole
4.8.4 directory together with all the sources, and 32-bit and 64-bit packages
(and be careful of the 'dot' at the end of that command, it is part of the
commandline !!):

  # rsync -av rsync://alien.slackbook.org/alien/ktown/4.8.4 .

OK.  Assuming you just downloaded the complete directory tree "4.8.4" and
everything below, you now change your current directory to where you found
this README (which is the directory called '4.8.4').  If you used the
above "rsync" command then that would mean a simple:

  # cd 4.8.4

From within this directory, you run the following commands as root.  Note that
some of the old KDE package names are obsoleted too, they have been split up,
renamed or integrated:

  On Slackware 32-bit:
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86/deps/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86/kde/*.t?z

  On Slackware 64-bit:
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86_64/deps/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86_64/kde/*.t?z

  If you already have one or more non-english language packs installed:
  # upgradepkg x86_64/kdei/*.t?z
  
  If you want to have a non-english language pack installed but none is
  currently installed, substitute your country code instead of the 'XX'
  in the next command:
  # upgradepkg --install-new x86_64/kdei/kde-l10n-XX-*.t?z

  Check if any ".new" configuration files have been left behind by
  the upgradepkg commands.  Compare them to their originals and decide
  if you need to use them.
  # find /etc/ -name "*.new"
  A graphical tool for processing these "*.new" files is slackpkg:
  # slackpkg new-config

Then reboot your system.
