KDE5
====

Here is KDE 5_17.03 for Slackware, consisting of the KDE Frameworks 5.32.0,
Plasma 5.9.3 and Applications 16.12.3 on top of Qt 5.7.1.

Upgrading from the previous 5_17.02 is straight-forward.

KDE-5_17.03 is meant to be installed on top of Slackware -current.
It will *replace* any version of KDE 4 you might have installed!  Plasma 5
has mostly gotten rid of its Qt4 legacy.

What is the NEWS in this batch of updates:
- The 'deps' section has some interesting updates this time. Two upgraded
  packages: phonon-vlc and qca-qt5. Also six new ones to support digikam
  and kdenlive: lensfun, opencv, frei0r-plugins, vid.stab, dvdauthor and mlt.
  You may already have one or more of these installed from SBo, so make sure
  to upgrade to mine to prevent breakage in digikam and kdenlive.  Notably,
  the SBo version of 'frei0r-plugins' package is called 'frei0r'.
- Frameworks 5.32.0 is an enhancement release, nothing exciting.
  See https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.32.0.php
- Plasma 5.9.3 is yet another iteration of the 5.9 series with small fixes only.
  See https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.9.3.php .
- Applications 16.12.3 is an incremental fix-release in the 16.12 series.
  See https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-16.12.3.php .
  This time I have built the 'libkface' and 'kdenlive' packages now that
  their dependencies have been fulfilled.
- Applications-extra contains two new packages: digikam and krusader.
  I have also added a beta release of k3b (now finally a KF5 port)
  which will see its first new official release as part of Applications
  17.04.  And finally, I upgraded the kdevelop related packages.
- In plasma-extra I rebuilt the sddm-qt5 package, enabling the dutch
  translation and making sure that SDDM picks up your $LANG settings.

Further points of interest:
- There are a couple of *runtime* dependencies that I did not add to the
  ktown repository, but you may want to consider installing them yourself:
  * vlc - will give phonon another backend to select from.
  * python-twisted - required by kajongg to start & run.
  * freerdp: access RDP servers through krdc.
  All of these can be found in my regular package repository.
- The following kde/kde4-extragear packages should be taken from slackware
  itself: kaudiocreator, kplayer, kwebkitpart, oxygen-gtk2 .
- Lots of packages in the 'deps' department are completely new to Slackware.
  Since KDE 5 aka Plasma 5 is built on Qt5 (KDE 4 uses Qt4 as its base)
  you'll find many Qt5 related packages.  Also, in order for Qt4 and GTK based
  applications to dock into the Plasma 5 system tray, more dependencies were
  needed.  So, apart from updates to regular Slackware packages and the
  new telepathy support packages (see below), these are the new ones:
  OpenAL, PyQT5, cfitsio, dvdauthor, frei0r-plugins, grantlee-qt4,
  hack-font-ttf, json-glib, lensfun, libappindicator, libdbusmenu-gtk,
  libdbusmenu-qt5, libdmtx, libindicator, libinput, libwacom, libxkbcommon,
  lmdb, mlt, ninja, noto-font-ttf, noto-cjk-font-ttf, opencv, polkit-qt5-1,
  qca-qt5, qrencode, qt-gstreamer, qt5, qt5-webkit, sni-qt, vid.stab
  and wayland.  As a side note, libinput and libwacom have become part of
  Slackware-current.  Technically that makes them redundant in the above
  listing, however I still compile Plasma5 packages for Slackware 14.2 so
  I left them in.
  The phonon package was extended so that it now supports both Qt4 and Qt5.
- A completely new subset of "deps" packages, contained in their own
  "telepathy" subdirectory, needed for KDE Telepathy:
  libotr, libnice, farstream, libaccounts-glib, libaccounts-qt5,
  signon, signon-plugin-oauth2, signon-ui, libsignon-glib, telegram-qt,
  telepathy-glib, telepathy-farstream, telepathy-haze, telepathy-gabble,
  telepathy-morse, telepathy-qt5, telepathy-logger, telepathy-logger-qt5,
  telepathy-mission-control and telepathy-accounts-signon.
- Telepathy for KDE packages are found in their own subdirectory kde/telepathy .
- The kde/kde4 and kde/kde4-extragear directories contain packages that are
  still required to support kdelibs4-based Applications.
- Also worth mentioning: the KF5 ports of k3b, calligra, krita, ktorrent,
  partitionmanager, skanlite and the KDE Development Suite can be found
  in kde/applications-extra . 
  Finally, kjots (previously contained in KDEPIM) and kuser have been moved
  into kde/applications-extra as well.

NOTE:
If you install a 32bit program on a 64bit Slackware computer with multilib
and that program needs legacy system tray support (think of Skype for
instance), you will have to grab the 32-bit version of Slackware's
'libdbusmenu-qt' and my ktown-deps package 'sni-qt', and run the
'convertpkg-compat32 -i' command on them to create 'compat32' versions of these
packages.  Then install both 'libdbusmenu-qt-compat32' and 'sni-qt-compat32'.
Those two are mandatory addons for displaying system tray icons of 32bit
binaries in 64bit multilib Plasma5.

NOTE:
Also explained in more detail below, upgrading to this KDE 5 is non-trivial.
You will have to remove old KDE 4 packages manually.  If you do not have KDE
installed at all, you will have to *install* some of Slackware's own KDE 4
packages manually.

NOTE:
If you decide to install these packages on top of a fresh installation of
  Slackware 14.2 or -current and have excluded all packages in the 'KDE'
  package series during installation, you will be missing several add-on
  packages.  You can optionally install the following Slackware packages:
    * amarok
    * kaudiocreator
    * kplayer
    * kwebkitpart
    * oxygen-gtk2

NOTE:
If you had installed KDE 4 as your default desktop previously, the removal
of KDE 4 packages will break the symbolic link '/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc'.
An attempt to run 'startx' in a console will fail with a black screen.
After installing Plasma 5 for the first time, you need to run 'xwmconfig'
and select 'xinitrc.plasma' as your desktop session.

Install pre-compiled packages:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In order to install or upgrade KDE 5, follow these steps:

Make sure you are not running KDE or even X !  If you are running an X session,
log out first, and if you are in runlevel 4 (graphical login) you first have to
go back to runlevel 3 (console) by typing "init 3".

If you still have a KDE 4 installed, it must be removed first. No clean
upgrade path can be provided!  Do as follows:

If you have Slackware 14.2 or -current's default KDE 4.14.3 installed:
  # removepkg /var/log/packages/*-4.14.3-*
  # removepkg libkscreen
  # removepkg kscreen
  # removepkg kactivities
  # removepkg kde-workspace
  # removepkg libmm-qt
  # removepkg libnm-qt
  # removepkg plasma-nm
  # removepkg polkit-kde-agent-1
  # removepkg polkit-kde-kcmodules-1
  # removepkg kdeconnect-kde
  # removepkg kdepimlibs
  # removepkg kdevelop-php
  # removepkg kdevelop-php-docs
  ..or instead of the above, simply '# slackpkg remove kde' and de-select
  the packages you want to keep (amarok, etc).

Alternativly, in case you are already using an older release of my KDE 5
packages, you need to look up that particular release in the list right below
(for instance: KDE 5_16.08) and then apply the actions shown for that KDE 5
release *and* all more recent releases, i.e. work your way back up to this
paragraph.  Note that some of the old KDE package names were obsoleted along
the way, they were split up, renamed or integrated and that is the reason
for some of the 'removepkg' lines you'll see below.
Here we go:

If you have my 'ktown' set of KDE 5_17.02 installed:
- No further actions are needed.

If you have my 'ktown' set of KDE 5_17.01 installed:
- No further actions are needed.

If you have my 'ktown' set of KDE 5_16.12 installed:
- Upgrade to KDE 5_17.01
  If you are running Slackware-current, manually install or upgrade libinput
  and libwacom to the Slackware versions.
  Remove the packages that no longer exist in KDE 5_17.01:
  * removepkg kactivities
  * removepkg nepomuk
  * removepkg nepomuk-widgets
  * removepkg gpgmepp
  * removepkg kde-baseapps kdepim kdewebdev

If you have my 'ktown' set of KDE 5_16.11 installed:
- Upgrade to KDE 5_16.12
  Remove the packages that no longer exist in KDE 5_16.12:
  * removepkg baloo
  * removepkg baloo-widgets

If you have my 'ktown' set of KDE 5_16.08 installed:
- No further actions are needed.

If you have my 'ktown' set of KDE 5_16.07 installed:
- Upgrade to KDE 5_16.08
  Remove the packages that no longer exist in KDE 5_16.07:
  * removepkg kdegraphics-strigi-analyzer
  * removepkg kdenetwork-strigi-analyzers
  * rempovepkg kdesdk-strigi-analyzers
  * removepkg kdepimlibs libkdeedu mplayerthumbs

If you have my 'ktown' set of KDE 5_16.06 installed:
- Upgrade to KDE 5_16.07
  Remove the packages that no longer exist in KDE 5_16.07:
  * removepkg /var/log/packages/noto-font-ttf-2015-09-29-noarch-1alien

If you have my 'ktown' set of KDE 5_16.05 installed:
- No further actions are needed.

If you have my 'ktown' set of KDE 5_16.04 installed:
- No further actions are needed.

If you have my 'ktown' set of KDE 5_16.03 installed:
- Upgrade to KDE 5_16.04
  Remove the packages that no longer exist in KDE 5_16.04:
  * removepkg kactivities-workspace

If you have my 'ktown' set of KDE 5_16.02 installed:
- No further actions are needed.

If you have my 'ktown' set of KDE 5_16.01 installed:
- No further actions are needed.

Then proceed with installing/upgrading KDE 5 as outlined below.

NOTE:
The example commands below are for Slackware -current but you can use
these commands for Slackware 14.2 as well by replacing the /current/
string with /14.2/ (provided there is a suitable 'ktown' release available
for Slackware 14.2 of course):

NOTE:
Instead of using the mirror host bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/
you could choose the master host alien.slackbook.org/alien/ktown/
but that will probably be a lot slower for some of you.

NOTE:
If you use 'slackpkg' to automate your upgrades, be sure to blacklist my
custom packages or else slackpkg will always try to replace my packages
with the stock Slackware versions if the package names are identical.
As an example, you can add the following lines to the file
"/etc/slackpkg/blacklist" to prevent this unintentional downgrading to KDE4:
  # These three lines will blacklist all SBo, alien and multilib packages:
  [0-9]+_SBo
  [0-9]+alien
  [0-9]+compat32
If on the other hand you are using the 'slackpkg+' extension for slackpkg
then your "/etc/slackpkg/blacklist" file should *not* contain the above
lines!  The slackpkg+ extension enables the use of 3rd-party repositories
with slackpkg and then Plasma5 package upgrades will be handled properly.


To make it easy for you, here is a one-line command that downloads the whole
'5' directory (excluding the sources), with 32-bit and 64-bit packages.

  # rsync -av rsync://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/current/5/ 5/

Or else, if you want to download packages for just one of the two supported
architectures, you would run one of the following commands instead (note that
there is a dot at the end of these commands!).

If you want only the 64-bit packages:
  # rsync -av --exclude=x86 rsync://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/current/5/ 5/
If you want only the 32-bit packages:
  # rsync -av --exclude=x86_64 rsync://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/current/5/ 5/

Assuming you just downloaded the bits you want from the directory tree "5",
you must now change your current directory to where you found this README
(which is the directory called '5').  If you used one of the above "rsync"
commands then you can simply do:

  # cd 5

From within this directory, you run the following commands as root:

  On Slackware 32-bit:
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86/deps/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86/deps/telepathy/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86/kde/*/*.t?z

  On Slackware 64-bit:
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86_64/deps/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86_64/deps/telepathy/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86_64/kde/*/*.t?z

  If you already have one or more non-english language packs installed:

  On Slackware 32-bit:
  # upgradepkg x86/kdei/*.t?z

  On Slackware 64-bit:
  # upgradepkg x86_64/kdei/*.t?z
  
  If you want to have a non-english language pack installed but none is
  currently installed, substitute your country code instead of the 'XX'
  in the next command:
  # upgradepkg --install-new x86_64/kdei/kde-l10n-XX-*.t?z

  Check if any ".new" configuration files have been left behind by
  the upgradepkg commands.  Compare them to their originals and decide
  if you need to use them.
  # find /etc/ -name "*.new"
  A graphical (ncurses) tool for processing these "*.new" files is slackpkg:
  # slackpkg new-config

Then reboot your system.

If all you want is to install the packages I created, then you can skip the
remainder of the README which details how to (re)compile the packages from
their sources; it is not required reading material.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building it all from source:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sources and scripts are separated from the packages in my 'ktown' repository.
If you want the sources for KDE 5, run the following command to download them
(downloading from a mirror will usually be much faster):

  # rsync -av rsync://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/source/5/ 5/

There are a lot of 'dependencies' for KDE 5 which you'll have to compile and
install before attempting to compile KDE 5. Compiling and installing these
dependencies on Slackware-current is as easy as:
  # cd 5/deps
  # ./updates.SlackBuild
  # cd -
  # cd 5/deps/telepathy
  # ./telepathy.SlackBuild
  # cd -

Be prepared to wait a *long* time since this will compile a new Qt5 package
among others.  The finished packages will be stored in /tmp and will already
have been installed/upgraded automatically.

Then if you want to compile the KDE packages on your computer, run:
  # cd 5/kde
  # ./KDE.SlackBuild

Wait a long time, and you will find the new packages in /tmp/kde_build .
Note that these packages will already have been installed by KDE.SlackBuild !
Reboot your computer and login to a Plasma session.
