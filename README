KDE 5_1501
==========

This is going to be KDE 5 for Slackware-current, composed of Frameworks 5.6.0,
Plasma 5.1.2 and Applications 14.12.1.

Compared to Applications 14.12.0, the Applications 14.12.1 adds LTS releases of
kdelibs, kdepimlibs, kdepim-runtime, kdepim and kde-workspace.
I am going to skip kde-workspace because its contents largely collide with
the plasma-workspace and we want to have a Plasma Workspace.

Note that there is still a lot of KDE 4 stuff in here, which is necessary to
support all the Applications that have not yet been ported to KDE Frameworks 5.
The Applications 15.04 (march 2015) release should offer a lot more KF5 ports.

Preliminary build procedure (not verified 100% yet):
----------------------------------------------------

- (crude) get rid of Slackware's KDE:
  # removepkg /var/log/packages/*-4.10.5-*
  # removepkg libkscreen
- build all the deps using "updates.SlackBuild" script in the "deps/" directory
  - note that extra-cmake-modules is required here as well as when building the
    frameworks, so I just copied it from frameworks to deps.
  - I removed akonadi-qt5 from the built deps because it won't be used until
    there is a kdepimlibs-framework, and currently it causes kdepimlibs-4.14
    to pick up Qt5 dependencies making its build fail
- logoff/login to activate Qt5 profile script.
- build all the KDE 4 stuff in the "kde/" directory, using "./KDE.SlackBuild kde libs kdebase:nepomuk-core kdepimlibs kdebase kdebindings kdepim extragear"
- check that everything built correctly
- build the remaining KDE 5 stuff in the "kde/" directory, using "./KDE.SlackBui
ld frameworks plasma plasma-extra polkit-kde applications"
- check that everything built correctly
- (optionally) build kdei

BUILD LOG FOR PLASMA:

DONE: Need to recompile everything making sure that Qt4 is not picked up by accident, or else set "export QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=path/to/qt/plugins" to get rid of the start-time error:
    Failed to load platform plugin "xcb". Available platforms are:
    linuxfb minimal offscreen xcb
    Aborted
    >> The fix was to rebuild the qt5 package, not all of the rest :-) 
SKIP: change "qtpaths" to "qtpaths-qt5" in /usr/bin/startkde
   (not needed for Slackware, because /etc/profile.d/qt5.sh expands $PATH)
SKIP: change "qdbus" to "qdbus-qt5" in /usr/bin/startkde
   (not needed for Slackware, because /etc/profile.d/qt5.sh expands $PATH)
SKIP: rename /usr/bin/startkde to /usr/bin/startkde5 because it clashes with the script from kde-workspace. Also update the plasma*desktop scripts to call startkde5 instead of startkde.
   (I removed kde-workspace instead, we do not need that anyway)
DONE: Remove kde5-plasma*.desktop because plasma-workspace now includes its own plasma.desktop

BUILD LOG FOR PLASMA-EXTRA:

DONE: sddm-qt5 (no longer adds an /etc/sddm.conf so we need to generate one in its doinst.sh)

BUILD LOG FOR APPLICATIONS:

DONE: kdoctools (needs a fix for its CMake search for path to "/usr/share/xml/docbook/xml-dtd-4.5/docbookx.dtd", which causes a build error in kde-dev-scripts later on)
DONE: kde-dev-scripts (needs a fixed "/usr/share/kf5/kdoctools/customization/dtd/kdex.dtd" in kdoctools)
SKIP: libkface (needs opencv, so this will get skipped due to my reservations with it)
DONE: kdeartwork (missed kde-workspace, will be fixed in the next iteration)
DONE: kdewebdev (seems like tidy added the KDE.SlackBuild parameter to the path of its header file)
DONE: kalgebra (needs patch to link properly to ncurses)
DONE: kanagram (needed libkeduvocdocument, was missing due to build order issue)
DONE: khangman (needed libkeduvocdocument, was missing due to build order issue)
DONE: parley (needed libkeduvocdocument, was missing due to build order issue)
DONE: okular (needed libkscreen removed)
DONE: kalgebra (needed a refreshed curses patch)
SKIP: step (don't understand where the compilation error comes from)
