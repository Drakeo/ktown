# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libsass:
libsass: LibSass is just a library. If you want to use LibSass to compile Sass,
libsass: you need an implementer. Some implementations are only bindings into
libsass: other programming languages. But most also ship with a command line
libsass: interface (CLI) you can use directly.
libsass: There is also SassC, which is the official lightweight CLI tool
libsass: built by the same people as LibSass.
