KDE4.12
=======

This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.12.5 for Slackware 14.1 and -current
(this was compiled on Slackware 14.1 as promised) !

This release includes version 4.11.9 of the Plasma Workspaces, since the
Workspaces were feature-frozen in 4.11.
KDE SC 4.12.5 is the final increment in the 4.12 series.  The 4.13 series
will be compiled for Slackware-current only.

The upgrade from Slackware 14.1's own 4.10.5 will be trivial.
Only four packages outside KDE (the 'deps') need an update: akonadi, attica,
shared-desktop-ontologies and soprano. One new dependency is introduced for
KDE 4.12, and that's LibRaw.

Four KDE packages have been removed since the KDE 4.10.5 of Slackware 14.1:
* kdeadmin, kdetoys, kdesdk and kdenetwork have been split up into smaller
  individual packages since 4.10.5.
One package has been renamed in 4.12: kwallet is now called kwalletmanager.
One additional rename took place after 4.12.3: kdnssd became zeroconf-ioslave.

Updates to 'extragear' packages are: Calligra and KDevelop.
A new package 'kdev-python' has been added, bringing Python support to KDevelop.

You have a choice of NetworkManager GUI: the original 'networkmanagement'
widget or the new QML based 'plasma-nm' applet.  The packages required for
the Plasma NetworkManager applet are: libmm-qt, libnm-qt and plasma-nm itself.

Added since 4.12.3 is 'kdeconnect-kde' which is the counterpart of the
Andriod application kdeconnect-android.  KDE Connect allows your Android
smartphone to interact with your KDE Desktop.

NOTE:
About the language packs (KDEI) - for Slackware 32-bit as well as 64-bit:
* KDE localizations (language packs) are available in the "kdei" subdirectory.
  You only need one package (for your own language).

NOTE:
If you decide to install these packages on top of a fresh installation of
  Slackware 14.1 and have excluded all packages in the 'KDE' package series
  during installation, you will be missing several add-on packages, some of
  these are essential to the proper functioning of KDE!
  If you excluded the complete Slackware 14.1 'KDE' series, then you
  will have to install the following essential Slackware 14.1 packages
  at a a minimum:
    * polkit-kde-agent-1
    * polkit-kde-kcmodules-1
  And optionally install these as well:
    * amarok
    * k3b
    * kaudiocreator
    * kdevelop-pg-qt
    * kplayer
    * wicd-kde

NOTE:
Sources and scripts have been separated from the packages in my 'ktown'
  repository starting with KDE 4.9-rc1.  If you want the sources for
  4.12.5, run the following command to download them:

  # rsync -av rsync://alien.slackbook.org/alien/ktown/source/4.12.5 .

Then if you want to compile the KDE packages on your computer, run:
  # cd 4.12.5/kde
  # ./KDE.SlackBuild

Wait a long time, and you will find the new packages in /tmp/kde-build .
Note that these packages will already have been installed by KDE.SlackBuild !

But if all you want is the packages I created, then you can skip all of that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to install or upgrade to KDE 4.12.5, follow these steps:

Make sure you are not running KDE or even X !  If you are running an X session,
log out first, and if you are in runlevel 4 (graphical login) you first have to
go back to runlevel 3 (console) by typing "init 3".

To make it easy for you, here is a one-line command that downloads the whole
4.12.5 directory (excluding the sources), with 32-bit and 64-bit packages
(and be careful of the 'dot' at the end of that command, it is part of the
commandline !!):

  # rsync -av rsync://alien.slackbook.org/alien/ktown/14.1/4.12.5 .

Or else, if you want to download packages for just one of the two supported
architectures, you would run one of the following commands instead (note that
there is a dot at the end of these commands!).

If you want only the 64-bit packages:
  # rsync -av --exclude=x86 rsync://alien.slackbook.org/alien/ktown/14.1/4.12.5 .
If you want only the 32-bit packages:
  # rsync -av --exclude=x86_64 rsync://alien.slackbook.org/alien/ktown/14.1/4.12.5 .

Assuming you just downloaded the bits you want from the directory tree
"4.12.5", you must now change your current directory to where you found this
README (which is the directory called '4.12.5').  If you used one of the
above "rsync" commands then you can simply do:

  # cd 4.12.5

From within this directory, you run the following commands as root (note that
some of the old KDE package names are obsoleted now, they have been split up,
renamed or integrated and that is the reason for the 'removepkg' lines):

  On Slackware 32-bit:
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86/deps/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86/kde/*.t?z
  # removepkg kdeadmin
  # removepkg kdenetwork
  # removepkg kdesdk
  # removepkg kdetoys
  # removepkg kwallet
  # removepkg kdnssd

  On Slackware 64-bit:
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86_64/deps/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86_64/kde/*.t?z
  # removepkg kdeadmin
  # removepkg kdenetwork
  # removepkg kdesdk
  # removepkg kdetoys
  # removepkg kwallet
  # removepkg kdnssd

  If you already have one or more non-english language packs installed:
  # upgradepkg x86_64/kdei/*.t?z
  
  If you want to have a non-english language pack installed but none is
  currently installed, substitute your country code instead of the 'XX'
  in the next command:
  # upgradepkg --install-new x86_64/kdei/kde-l10n-XX-*.t?z

  Check if any ".new" configuration files have been left behind by
  the upgradepkg commands.  Compare them to their originals and decide
  if you need to use them.
  # find /etc/ -name "*.new"
  A graphical (ncurses) tool for processing these "*.new" files is slackpkg:
  # slackpkg new-config

Then reboot your system.
