KDE5
====

Here is KDE 5_18.01 for Slackware, consisting of the KDE Frameworks 5.42.0,
Plasma 5.11.5 and Applications 17.12.1 on top of Qt 5.9.3.

Upgrading from the previous 5_17.12 is relatively straight-forward.

KDE-5_18.01 is meant to be installed on top of Slackware -current.
It will *replace* any version of KDE 4 you might have installed!
The Plasma 5 Desktop has gotten rid of its Qt4 legacy.  Applications 17.12
no longer ships anything based on kdelibs4.

What is the NEWS in this batch of updates:
Compared to last month when we said good-bye to the KDE4 legacy, there's
nothing really exciting to report this time.
- Frameworks update is a stability release, see:
  https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.42.0.php .
- Plasma also is a stability update, see
  https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.11.5.php .
  I compiled plasma5-nm against openconnect so that it picks up support for
  it.  However I did not add openconnect to the 'deps' section, you need
  to install it separately if you need it. 
- Applications 17.12.1 is the first incremental update for the 17.12 series
  and fixes some bugs.
  See https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-17.12.1.php .
- In applications-extra I have recompiled kjots.  Upgraded are digikam, krita,
  partitionmanager, kstars, kdevelop,kdev-php and kdev-python.
  The kdevplatform package has been removed as it is no longer part
  of the KDEvelop suite.

Further points of interest:
- If you have a KDE4-based application that needs library support on this
  Plasma 5 desktop, let me know which of the removed packages needs to return
  in 'kde/kde4'!
- There are a couple of *runtime* dependencies that I did not add to the
  ktown repository, but you may want to consider installing them yourself:
  * vlc - will give phonon another backend to select from.
  * freerdp: access RDP servers through krdc.
  * openconnect: support for Cisco's SSL VPN.
  All of these can be found in my regular package repository.
- There's no more need to install any KDE4 package from Slackware 14.2.
- Lots of packages in the 'deps' department are completely new to Slackware.
  Since KDE 5 aka Plasma 5 is built on Qt5 (KDE 4 uses Qt4 as its base)
  you'll find many Qt5 related packages.  Also, in order for Qt4 and GTK based
  applications to dock into the Plasma 5 system tray, more dependencies were
  needed.  So, apart from updates to regular Slackware packages and the
  new telepathy support packages (see below), these are the new ones:
  OpenAL, PyQT5, accountsservice, cfitsio, cracklib, ddcutil, dvdauthor,
  frei0r-plugins, grantlee-qt4, hack-font-ttf, id3lib, json-glib, lensfun,
  libappindicator, libburn, libdbusmenu-gtk, libdbusmenu-qt5, libdmtx,
  libindicator, libinput, libpwquality, libwacom, libxkbcommon, lmdb, mlt,
  ninja, noto-font-ttf, noto-cjk-font-ttf, opencv, polkit-qt5-1, qca-qt5,
  qrencode, qt-gstreamer, qt5, qt5-webkit, qtav, sni-qt, vid.stab
  and wayland.
  As a side note, libinput and libwacom have become part of Slackware-current.
  Technically that makes them redundant in the above listing, however I still
  compile Plasma5 packages for Slackware 14.2 so I left them in.
  The phonon and poppler packages were extended so that they now support
  Qt5 as well as Qt4.
  Note that the SBo version of 'frei0r-plugins' package is called 'frei0r'.
  If you have that SBo package installed, remove it.
- A completely new subset of "deps" packages, contained in their own
  "telepathy" subdirectory, needed for KDE Telepathy:
  libotr, libnice, farstream, libaccounts-glib, libaccounts-qt5,
  signon, signon-plugin-oauth2, signon-ui, libsignon-glib, telegram-qt,
  telepathy-glib, telepathy-farstream, telepathy-haze, telepathy-gabble,
  telepathy-morse, telepathy-qt5, telepathy-logger, telepathy-logger-qt5,
  telepathy-mission-control and telepathy-accounts-signon.
- Telepathy for KDE packages are found in their own subdirectory kde/telepathy .

NOTE:
If you install a 32bit program on a 64bit Slackware computer with multilib
and that program needs legacy system tray support (think of Steam for
instance), you will have to grab the 32-bit version of Slackware's
'libdbusmenu-qt' and my ktown-deps package 'sni-qt', and run the
'convertpkg-compat32 -i' command on them to create 'compat32' versions
of these packages.  Then install both 'libdbusmenu-qt-compat32' and
'sni-qt-compat32'.  Those two are mandatory addons for displaying
system tray icons of 32bit binaries in 64bit multilib Plasma5.

NOTE:
Also explained in more detail below, upgrading to this KDE 5 is non-trivial.
You will have to remove old KDE 4 packages manually.

NOTE:
If you had installed KDE 4 as your default desktop previously, the removal
of KDE 4 packages will break the symbolic link '/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc'.
An attempt to run 'startx' in a console will fail with a black screen.
After installing Plasma 5 for the first time, you need to run 'xwmconfig'
and select 'xinitrc.plasma' as your desktop session.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install pre-compiled packages:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In order to install or upgrade KDE 5, follow these steps:

Make sure you are not running KDE or even X !  If you are running an X session,
log out first, and if you are in runlevel 4 (graphical login) you first have to
go back to runlevel 3 (console) by typing "init 3".

If you still have a KDE 4 installed, it must be removed first. No clean
upgrade path can be provided!  Do as follows:

If you have Slackware 14.2 or -current's default KDE 4.14.3 installed:
  # removepkg /var/log/packages/*-4.14.3-*
  # removepkg libkscreen
  # removepkg kscreen
  # removepkg kactivities
  # removepkg kde-workspace
  # removepkg libmm-qt
  # removepkg libnm-qt
  # removepkg plasma-nm
  # removepkg polkit-kde-agent-1
  # removepkg polkit-kde-kcmodules-1
  # removepkg kdeconnect-kde
  # removepkg kdepim
  # removepkg kdepimlibs
  # removepkg kdev-python
  # removepkg kdevelop-php
  # removepkg kdevelop-php-docs
  ..or instead of the above, simply '# slackpkg remove kde'.

Alternatively, in case you are already using an older release of my KDE 5
packages, you need to look up that particular release in the list right below
(for instance: KDE 5_17.10) and then apply the actions shown for that KDE 5
release *and* all more recent releases, i.e. work your way back up to this
paragraph.  Note that some of the old KDE package names were obsoleted along
the way, they were split up, renamed or integrated and that is the reason
for some of the 'removepkg' lines you'll see below.

Then proceed with installing/upgrading KDE 5 as outlined below.

NOTE:
The example commands below are for Slackware -current but you can use
these commands for Slackware 14.2 as well; by replacing the /current/
string with /14.2/ (provided there is a suitable 'ktown' release available
for Slackware 14.2 of course):

NOTE:
Instead of using the mirror host http://slackware.nl/alien-kde/ (its rsync URI
is rsync://slackware.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/), you could choose the alternative
mirror http://slackware.uk/people/alien-kde/ (its rsync URI is
rsync://slackware.uk/people/alien-kde/)

NOTE:
If you use 'slackpkg' to automate your upgrades, be sure to blacklist my
custom packages or else slackpkg will always try to replace my packages
with the stock Slackware versions if the package names are identical.
As an example, you can add the following lines to the file
"/etc/slackpkg/blacklist" to prevent this unintentional downgrading to KDE4:
  # These three lines will blacklist all SBo, alien and multilib packages:
  [0-9]+_SBo
  [0-9]+alien
  [0-9]+compat32
If on the other hand you are using the 'slackpkg+' extension for slackpkg
then your "/etc/slackpkg/blacklist" file should *not* contain the above
lines!  The slackpkg+ extension enables the use of 3rd-party repositories
with slackpkg and then Plasma5 package upgrades will be handled properly.


To make it easy for you, here is a one-line command that downloads the whole
'5' directory (excluding the sources), with 32-bit and 64-bit packages.

  # rsync -Hav rsync://slackware.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/current/5/ 5/

Or else, if you want to download packages for just one of the two supported
architectures, you would run one of the following commands instead.

If you want only the 64-bit packages:
  # rsync -Hav --exclude=x86 rsync://slackware.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/current/5/ 5/
If you want only the 32-bit packages:
  # rsync -Hav --exclude=x86_64 rsync://slackware.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/current/5/ 5/

Assuming you just downloaded the bits you want from the directory tree "5",
you must now change your current directory to where you found this README
(which is the directory called '5').  If you used one of the above "rsync"
commands then you can simply do:

  # cd 5

From within this directory, you run the following commands as root:

  On Slackware 32-bit:
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86/deps/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86/deps/telepathy/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86/kde/*/*.t?z

  On Slackware 64-bit:
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86_64/deps/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86_64/deps/telepathy/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86_64/kde/*/*.t?z

  Check if any ".new" configuration files have been left behind by
  the upgradepkg commands.  Compare them to their originals and decide
  if you need to use them.
  # find /etc/ -name "*.new"
  A graphical (ncurses) tool for processing these "*.new" files is slackpkg:
  # slackpkg new-config

Then reboot your system.

If all you want is to install the packages I created, then you can skip the
remainder of the README which details how to (re)compile the packages from
their sources; it is not required reading material.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building it all from source:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sources and scripts are separated from the packages in my 'ktown' repository.
If you want the sources for KDE 5, run the following command to download them
(downloading from a mirror will usually be much faster):

  # rsync -Hav rsync://slackware.nl/mirrors/alien-kde/source/5/ 5/

There are a lot of 'dependencies' for KDE 5 which you'll have to compile and
install before attempting to compile KDE 5. Compiling and installing these
dependencies on Slackware-current is hopefully (have not tested the scripts
'updates.SlackBuild' and 'alldeps.SlackBuild' in a long time) as easy as this:
  # cd 5/deps
  # ./updates.SlackBuild
  # cd -
  # cd 5/deps/telepathy
  # ./telepathy.SlackBuild
  # cd -

Be prepared to wait a *long* time since this will compile a new Qt5 package
among others.  The finished packages will be stored in /tmp and will already
have been installed/upgraded automatically.

Then if you want to compile the KDE packages on your computer, run:
  # cd 5/kde
  # ./KDE.SlackBuild

Wait a long time, and you will find the new packages in /tmp/kde_build .
Note that these packages will already have been installed by KDE.SlackBuild !
Reboot your computer and login to a Plasma session.
