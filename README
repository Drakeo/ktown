KDE4.9
======

This is the KDE Software Compilation 4.9.5 for Slackware 14 and later.

You have to run Slackware 14 in order to use these packages!

The upgrade from Slackware's own 4.8.5 will be trivial.  I added five
updated dependencies (akonadi, qt, soprano, shared-desktop-ontologies and
virtuoso-ose).

I updated several 'extragear' packages compared to Slackware 14: kdevelop,
kdevplatform, oxygen-gtk2, and two are all new, oxygen-gtk3 and kio-mtp.

Two KDE packages have been removed since the KDE 4.8.5 of Slackware 14:
* kdemultimedia has been split up into several smaller individual packages.
* ksecrets has been removed completely in the 4.9.x series.

NOTE:
* Possible issue when rebuilding these packages on 13.37: the new kwin
  requires at least mesa-7.10 and this is not installed by default.
  Slackware 13.37 has mesa-7.10.2 in the /testing directory though.  Use that.
  It looks like KDE 4.9.x is the last series which will actually build on 13.37.

NOTE:
About the language packs (KDEI) - for Slackware 32-bit as well as 64-bit:
* KDE localizations (language packs) are available in "x86_64/kdei". You only
  need one package (for your own language).  Don't let the "x86_64" in the
  directory name fool you, the language packs are useable on both platforms.
  translations/localizations.

NOTE:
Sources and scripts have been separated from the packages in my 'ktown
  repository starting with KDE 4.9-rc1.  If you want the sources for
  4.9.5, run the following command to download them:

  # rsync -av rsync://alien.slackbook.org/alien/ktown/source/4.9.5 .

  But if all you want is the packages then you can skip the above command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to install or upgrade to KDE 4.9.5, follow these steps:

Make sure you are not running KDE or even X !  If you are running an X session,
log out first, and if you are in runlevel 4 (graphical login) you first have to
go back to runlevel 3 (console) by typing "init 3".

To make it easy for you, here is a one-line command that downloads the whole
4.9.5 directory (excluding the sources), with 32-bit and 64-bit packages
(and be careful of the 'dot' at the end of that command, it is part of the
commandline !!):

  # rsync -av rsync://alien.slackbook.org/alien/ktown/14.0/4.9.5 .

Or else, if you want to download packages for just one of the two supported
architectures, you would run one of the following commands instead.
If you want only the 64-bit packages:
  # rsync -av --exclude=x86 rsync://alien.slackbook.org/alien/ktown/14.0/4.9.5 .
If you want only the 32-bit packages:
  # rsync -av --exclude=x86_64 rsync://alien.slackbook.org/alien/ktown/14.0/4.9.5 .

OK.  Assuming you just downloaded the bits you want from directory tree "4.9.5" and below that, you now change your current directory to where you found
this README (which is the directory called '4.9.5').  If you used one of the
above "rsync" commands then that would mean a simple:

  # cd 4.9.5

From within this directory, you run the following commands as root.  Note that
some of the old KDE package names are obsoleted too, they have been split up,
renamed or integrated:

  On Slackware 32-bit:
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86/deps/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86/kde/*.t?z
  # removepkg kdemultimedia
  # removepkg ksecrets

  On Slackware 64-bit:
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86_64/deps/*.t?z
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new x86_64/kde/*.t?z
  # removepkg kdemultimedia
  # removepkg ksecrets

  If you already have one or more non-english language packs installed:
  # upgradepkg x86_64/kdei/*.t?z
  
  If you want to have a non-english language pack installed but none is
  currently installed, substitute your country code instead of the 'XX'
  in the next command:
  # upgradepkg --install-new x86_64/kdei/kde-l10n-XX-*.t?z

  Check if any ".new" configuration files have been left behind by
  the upgradepkg commands.  Compare them to their originals and decide
  if you need to use them.
  # find /etc/ -name "*.new"
  A graphical (ncrses) tool for processing these "*.new" files is slackpkg:
  # slackpkg new-config

Then reboot your system.
